gsirilic mode needs:

  _ not allowed in IDs (verify)
  \n \t should output a literal n or t respectively
  suppress the START, FINISH and ABORT built ins
  (verify microsiril behaviour for these)

  MUSIC

    "DEFAULT" <-- CRUs, queens, (whits), tits, kings
    "?5678"   <-- ordinary pattern but with ? instead of *
    "7890s"   <-- "[7890]{4}*"

    What is the output format?  (see. p11)

  ATW

    "[LON]"   <-- look at position of bells and store under 'LON'

    counts: 
      number of invocations of counter (i.e. # leads)
      number of rows until next marker invocation (i.e. # rows)
      how many times each place bell rings each lead
      number of changs of method
