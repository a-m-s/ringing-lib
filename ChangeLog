	called Grandsire   Little.)

	- Added functionality to multtab to factor out part ends (although
	currently   only cyclic part end groups).

	local	directory and not the include path.)
	
	- Fixed bug in iterator base class to extent_iterator.
	
	- Changed various integer return types to booleans in row.h,
	row.cpp,   method.h and method.cpp.  Also added an extra exception

	Removed a pair of gcc-3.0.1 compiler errors from psline.cpp
	
	- Unlined begin() and end() functions in classes derived from
	touch_node.    (I've yet to see a compiler that can inline virtual
	function calls on    heap-allocated objects, anyway).  Also moved
	the iterator nested type    in these classes into the source file
	-- it was only used by begin() and    end().
	
	- Made touch_node::iterator_base protected, at least for compilers
	that   can cope with it being protected.

	autoconf   test and corresponding macros.

	(reference counted) shared_pointer class.
	
	- Added a touch class to own a collection of touch nodes in a way
	that   allows touches to be returned from functions.
	
	- Added standard iterator typedefs to touch_node::iterator and
	hacked it   so that it works with the msvc-5 algorithms (which
	require derivation   from std::iterator) and also with some builds
	of gcc-2.95.x and all builds   of gcc-2.8.x (which do not have
	std::iterator) with glibstd++.
