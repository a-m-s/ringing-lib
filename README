This is the Ringing Class Library, and this file contains some notes
about installing and using the library.

Introduction
------------

  The Ringing Class Library is a collection of C++ classes which represent
the objects studied in English change ringing.  These include rows, changes,
methods and method libraries.  The project's home page can be found at
  http://ringing-lib.sourceforge.net/
where there is also information about how you can contribute, report bugs,
and get at discussion forums.


Installation
------------

  If you have a Unix-like system, you should be able to type ./configure to
configure the package.  In particular, this will look at whether your C++
compiler supports various language features such as namespaces and exceptions.
The results of these tests are put into the file ringing/common.h as macro
definitions.  It is possible that you will want to edit this file by hand to
change the default behaviour of the class library.  You can then type `make'
to compile the package, and `make install' to install it.  For more details,
see the file INSTALL in this directory.
  If you are using Windows or any other system on which ./configure does not
work, you should copy the file ringing/common.h.in to ringing/common.h and
edit it to indicate how your C++ compiler behaves and where your standard
header files are to be found.  The comments in that file explain which parts
need to be customised.  After customisation, you should be able to compile
all the files in the `ringing' directory into a library.  You should then
install all the header files in that directory to somewhere where your C++
compiler will find them (as #include <ringing/row.h> etc.)
  If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, a workspace file (ringing-lib.dsw)
is provided.  This contains project files to build the ringing class library 
itself as well as the example programs.  

Using the library
-----------------

  The documentation describing how to use the library is in the `doc' sub-
directory.  If you don't have the software necessary to build the Texinfo
documentation, you can download it separately in various formats.


Building as a shared library
----------------------------

  First make sure that you have a copy of the Class Library that supports this.
This copy only has experimental support for this.

  If you are on Windows and are building a DLL, make sure that you set 
RINGING_AS_DLL to 1 in common.h.in, and make sure that $always_dll = 1 in 
mkdsp.  Generate a workspace and project files by running ./mkdsp.

  If you are not on Windows and are building a shared object, make sure that
RINGING_AS_DLL is 0 in common.h.in.
