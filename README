This is the Ringing Class Library, and this file contains some notes
about installing and using the library.

Introduction
------------

  The Ringing Class Library is a collection of C++ classes which represent
the objects studied in English change ringing.  These include rows, changes,
methods and method libraries.  The project's home page can be found at
  http://ringing-lib.sourceforge.net/
where there is also information about how you can contribute, report bugs,
and get at discussion forums.


Installation
------------

  If you have a Unix-like system, you should be able to type ./configure to
configure the package.  In particular, this will look at whether your C++
compiler supports various language features such as namespaces and exceptions.
The results of these tests are put into the file ringing/common-am.h as macro
definitions.  It is possible that you will want to edit this file by hand to
change the default behaviour of the class library.  You can then type `make'
to compile the package, and `make install' to install it.  For more details,
see the file INSTALL in this directory.

  If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, a workspace file (ringing-lib.dsw)
is provided.  This contains project files to build the ringing class library 
itself as well as the example programs.  There should be no need to create the
file ringing/common-am.h by hand as a Visual Studio specific version of the
file (called ringing/common-msvc.h) is supplied and used automatically.  After
compiling the library, you may wish to copy all the header files in the 
`ringing' directory to somewhere your C++ compiler will find them.

  If you are using Windows with a compiler other than Microsoft Visual Studio,
or any other system on which ./configure does not work, you should copy the 
file ringing/common-am.h.in to ringing/common-am.h and edit it to indicate how
your C++ compiler behaves and where your standard header files are to be 
found.  The comments in that file explain which parts need to be customised.  
After customisation, you should be able to compile all the files in the 
`ringing' directory into a library.  You should then install all the header 
files in that directory to somewhere where your C++ compiler will find them 
(as #include <ringing/row.h> etc.)


Using the library
-----------------

  The documentation describing how to use the library is in the `doc' sub-
directory.  If you don't have the software necessary to build the Texinfo
documentation, you can download it separately in various formats.


Supported compilers
-------------------

  It is hoped that the class library will compile on any modern C++ compilers 
with any recent STL.  The library is regularly tested on the following 
compilers:

    gcc 3.0.1
    gcc 2.95.3
    egcs 1.1.2 (aka 2.91.66)
    msvc 7 (aka .NET)
    msvc 6
    msvc 5
