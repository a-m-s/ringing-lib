On debian, in order to configure and build the package you need at least:

  apt-get install make g++

To check out from CVS and generate the configure script you also need:

  apt-get install cvs autoconf automake libtool

Some of the class library's applications have optional dependencies on:

  apt-get install libreadline-dev libgdome2-dev

The test suites for gsiril and methsearch will not be run without:

  apt-get install dejagnu

The gsiril man page only gets built if:

  apt-get install help2man

And the methsearch documentation only gets built if all of these are present:

  apt-get install texlive-xetex ttf-linux-libertine \
    texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra

(Note that the ./configure test for this is not ideal.  If you have some but 
not all of the above tex packages installed, you'll get odd errors when
make runs xelatex.)
